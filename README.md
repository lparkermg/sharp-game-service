# SharpGameService

A small and relatively basic library for building game servers and server based game logic.

## Library specific readmes

- [SharpGameService.Core README](./src/SharpGameService/SharpGameService.Core/Documentation/README.md)
- [SharpGameService.Extensions](./src/SharpGameService/SharpGameService.Extensions/Documentation/README.md)

## Future features?

I may of may not do some updates to this project, but if I do I at least want to sort the following:

- Server admin - Currently there's not really much in the form of admin for doing things like closing rooms, kicking or banning players.
- Data persistence - This is more of a big maybe, as it would be good for MMOs, single player games etc but I'm 50/50 on if this should be something this does, or leave it to specific implementations.
